 * Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types of events fired by OWNER

 * See the {@link org.aeonbits.owner.event.Event} class. Events are fired by event sources. An event
 * listener registers with an event source to receive notifications about the events of a particular
 * type. This package defines events and event listeners, as well as event listener adapters, which
 * are convenience classes to make easier the process of writing event listeners.
