/**
 * <p> The goal of OWNER API is to minimize the code required to handle application configuration
 * through Java properties files. </p>
 *
 * <p> The approach used by OWNER APIs, is to define a Java interface associated to a properties
 * file. </p>
 *
 * Suppose your properties file is defined as ServerConfig.properties:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  port=80
 *  hostname=foobar.com
 *  maxThreads=100
 *  </pre>
 *
 * To access this property you need to define a convenient Java interface in ServerConfig.java:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  public interface ServerConfig extends Config {
 *      int port();
 *      String hostname();
 *
 *      &#64;DefaultValue("42");
 *      int maxThreads();
 *  }
 *  </pre>
 *
 * <p> We'll call this interface the Properties Mapping Interface or just Mapping Interface since
 * its goal is to map Properties into a an easy to use piece of code. </p>
 *
 * <p> Owner has a lot of features and its behavior is fully customizable to your needs. </p> <p>
 * Have a look at the full documentation from the <a href="http://owner.aeonbits.org/"
 * target="_top">OWNER website</a>. </p>
